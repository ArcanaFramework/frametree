Installation
============

FrameTree requires a recent version of Python (>=3.8) to run. So you may
need to upgrade your Python version before it is installed. It can be installed along
with its dependencies from the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.org>`_ using *Pip3*

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install frametree

To add support for XNAT_ or BIDS_ stores you will also need to install the respective
extension modules ``frametree-xnat`` and ``frametree-bids``, e.g.


.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install frametree-xnat frametree-bids



.. _XNAT: https://xnat.org
.. _BIDS: https://bids.neuroimaging.io
