Installation
============

FrameTree requires a recent version of Python (>=3.8) to run. So you may
need to upgrade your Python version before it is installed. It can be installed along
with its dependencies from the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.org>`_ using *Pip3*

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install frametree
